# Ethernaut-challenges
OpenZeppelin's Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity-based wargame that provides Capture the Flag (CTF) styled challenges where you have to go through their levels, read the smart contract code provided to you, and either claim the ownership, drain all the Ether from the contract or compromise the contract according to their level objectives.

## Solutions
I will be completing all levels of Ethernaut to ramp up on my Solidity skills
